For campers that wish to continue their studies, here are some links for you!

- Start off by going over the coding fundamentals that you may have just seen 
  for the first or second time. The more you see these, the easier it will be
  for you to use them.
  
https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java
- From there, it is time to learn a "real" programming language or at least
  Java, wher you have to declare variable types and utilize curly brackets
  to structure your code.

- Here is a playlist from my favorite youtube coder, Derek Banas. He has a
  metric butt ton of programming videos that will teach you whatever language
  you want to learn in just one video! I would suggest going over the languages
  that you have been learning already before moving on to the next one. 
  AND CODE ALONG!!!!
